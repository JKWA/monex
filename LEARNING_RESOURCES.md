### [Elixir and Monads: Identity](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/06/15/monad-identity.html)

This post introduces the fundamentals of the Identity monad, the simplest monad used to wrap and operate on a single value. It lays the groundwork for understanding monads in Elixir by explaining key functions like `map`, `bind`, and `ap`, and their implementation using Elixir's `defprotocol`. By starting with the basic Identity monad, this post sets the stage for more complex monads to follow.

### [Elixir and Monads: Equality and Order](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/06/17/eq-ord.html)

Building on the Identity monad, this post introduces custom protocols to handle equality and ordering within monads. It explains the `Eq` protocol for comparing monadic values and the `Ord` protocol for ordering them, extending the principles of the Identity monad with new functionality. These protocols show how monads establish consistent comparisons and ordering across different contexts.

### [Elixir and Monads: Maybe](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/06/20/monad-maybe.html)

The `Maybe` monad expands on the previous concepts by introducing the notion of optional values, represented by `Just` and `Nothing`. This post demonstrates how to handle missing values safely without null checks, extending the Identity monadâ€™s principles to more practical scenarios. It also shows how the `Eq` and `Ord` protocols apply to the `Maybe` context, while introducing operations like `filter`, `fold`, and `get_or_else`.

### [Elixir and Monads: Either](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/06/25/monad-either.html)

The `Either` monad extends the `Maybe` monad by handling two distinct possibilities: `Right` (success) and `Left` (error). This post explores how `Either` differs from `Maybe`, particularly in managing error propagation. Functions like `ap`, `bind`, and `map` are adapted to handle success and failure paths, while `fold`, `sequence`, and `traverse` enable working with lists of `Either` values. This demonstrates how monads manage multiple outcomes and deal with success and error paths in effectful code.

### [Elixir and Monads: Example](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/06/27/monad-example.html)

This post compares two approaches to handling business logic in Elixir: a typical tuple-based approach and monadic composition. It demonstrates how monads, specifically the `Either` monad, abstract away error handling and streamline operations by leveraging functions like `bind` and `map`. This post shows how monads can enhance composability and maintainability in complex workflows.

### [Elixir and Monads: Task](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/07/01/monad-task.html)

This post addresses the challenges of using Elixirâ€™s eager `Task` in monadic composition. It introduces `LazyTask`, a module that defers task execution until explicitly invoked, allowing tasks to be composed and passed between processes.

### [Elixir and Monads: LazyTaskEither](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/07/07/monad-lazy-task-either.html)

`LazyTaskEither` combines the error handling of `Either` with the deferred execution of `LazyTask`, allowing for the composition of asynchronous operations that may fail. This post explains how `LazyTaskEither` manages both success (`Right`) and error (`Left`) contexts while deferring execution until `run/1` is called. It covers key functions like `bind`, `map`, and `ap`, showing how to integrate error handling into complex, asynchronous workflows in a clean, functional style.

### [Elixir and Monads: Async Example](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/07/09/monad-example-2.html)

Continuing from [the previous post](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/06/27/monad-example.html) on handling business logic with the `Either` monad, this post extends the discussion to asynchronous operations using `LazyTaskEither`. It demonstrates how monadic composition can be applied to handle tasks like input validation and availability checks while managing both success (`Right`) and failure (`Left`) paths. By deferring execution with `LazyTaskEither`, asynchronous workflows are structured in the same way as synchronous ones, maintaining consistency and composability in error handling.

### [Elixir and Applicatives: Validation](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/07/11/applicative-validation.html)

This post explores how the applicative approach to validation allows the collection of all errors without short-circuiting, unlike monads. It introduces `sequence_a/2` (sequence applicative) in the `Either` and `LazyTaskEither`, along with `validate/2`, which accumulates errors rather than stopping at the first failure. This post highlights the benefits of applicative validation in scenarios requiring multiple checks.

### [Elixir and Monads: Operators](https://www.joekoski.com/blog/2024/07/14/monad-operators.html)

Inspired by Haskell's monadic operators, this post introduces custom operators for working with monads in Elixir using macros. It defines operators like `~>`, `~>>`, and `<<~` for `map`, `bind`, and `ap` functions, enabling more concise and expressive monadic composition. The post also explores the trade-offs between conciseness and readability when using custom operators.
